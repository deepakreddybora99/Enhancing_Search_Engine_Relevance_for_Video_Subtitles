didnt want them to see us. and if a short while before we had in some dim kind of way wanted them to come into the camp now very strongly we wantedthem to stay where they were. or else to go away. when you see them theres nothing todistinguish them you know. shaved heads and sunkencheeks theres no way. its hard to even see them as human. under the circumstances you try to avoid seeing them too much. its hard to do. i took a fewsteps away from the soldiers when i heard a sound that was terrible which i could not at first identify even though in some strange remote way it seemed familiar to me. and i understand. my daughter was crying. for the first time in three years this little child was crying. she was crying so hard that i thought her thinlittle body would collapse under the force of its convulsions. i tell you ive never in my life heard any cry of pain like that childs. it was the most tragic wail ive known. and i i followed my daughters example. i sat down with her and forseveral minutes i screamed. control was goneafter the sites we saw. the men were deliberately wounding guards and then turning themover to the prisoners and allowing them to have their revenge. our first act as freemen was to throw ourselves onto the provisions. we thought only of that not of revenge not of our families nothing but bread. when i was liberatedwe ate and ate and ate. no feeling when its enough just the knowledge that im hungry and maybe tomorrow i wont have. we didnt know how to stop. in theirfrenzy to fill themselves many survivors ruptured their stomachs. others who have hungso tenaciously to life no longer have the strengthto fight off the typhus and tuberculosis thatraged through the camps. within a few weeks of thearrival of the allies thousands of the liberatedprisoners perish. at bergenbelsen alone there are  corpses to bury. i didnt feel anything at all except jesus christ jesuschrist jesus christ. i kept saying that to myself because i couldnt think of anything else. you got over feeling thatthese were people anymore. they were so thin so dried up that they might have beenmonkeys or plaster of paris. you had to keep saying to yourself these are human beings. even when you said it yourmind was not believing it because nothing like thishad ever happened before. it just couldnt happen. the liberators razed the camps and tried to put the mass graves and the stench of death behind them. the jews watch the flamesand wondered what lies ahead. what specimensof humanity they are after the treatment they have received. i am certain that  of those who survive will never really be normal. they have suffered too much. it was on the last month. my brother older than me cameto the fence of my barrack and told me we donthave the parents anymore. the only one you had was mebut now they take me away. we will never meet again. i dont believe thishell will take an end. i dont see any light inthe edge of this tunnel. you are adult enough. i was almost eight years old. to understand what im telling you i want you to know thatif a miracle will happen and they will come andyou will survive this hell there is a place on theworld named eretz israel. repeat the name and dont forget it. eretz israel the land of israel. this is our old homeland. this is the place wherethey dont kill the jews. so if you survive tellanybody whom you meet that they have to take youto that particular place. eretz israel. in new york americans revel in their victory in europe. in london they crowd the squares to cheer the end of six long years of war. even in palestine theresdancing in the streets. the day of victory sad very sad writes david bengurion in his diary. like other leaders of of world jewry the chairman of thejewish agency in palestine has watched the war from afar helpless to avert the slaughter of six million european jews. to the jews eretzisrael is a land in which they have had a continued year presence. even after the romans destroyed jerusalem and expelled them in the second century jews remained faithful totheir dream of returning to their biblical homeland. the arabs invaded palestinein the seventh century and remained there even though the land was conquered and reconquered. as more and more europeansjews began to flee to palestine to escape hitler the arabs grew fearful that the jews might become a majority. since world war ibritain has administered this divided land under aleague of nations mandate trying to appease boththe arabs and the jews and protect its own imperialinterests in the middle east. although britain at first promised to establish a nationalhomeland for the jews under pressure from thearabs it changed its policy. in  the british issued a white paper severely restricting jewish immigration. in june  the britishwere allowing no more than  jews to enterpalestine each month. world war ii has left europe in ruins. in germany some  million refugees wander through a nightmare land of famine disease and desperation. allied troops tried to imposesome semblance of order on the anarchy and chaos they find. the refugees come from all overcentral and eastern europe russia and the baltic states. they include former slave laborers concentration camp inmatesmilitary conscripts and prisoners of war. they are officially classifiedas displaced persons. jews make up about  of the dps but as soon as they arestrong enough to travel many return home tosearch for their families. the bodythe marvel of the body. it heals with unbelievable speed. at the liberation i weighed  pounds. i couldnt stand on my feet. and months later i went home on my own. it is beyond words to describewhat the human body is what a human being is.  i was so anxious to gohome and see if im alive i hope that my parents and mybrothers will come home too. i got home i didnt find anybody yet. when young men my brothersage started coming home we ran to them as fastas we had the strength. and i had a million questions to ask. boys did you worktogether with my brothers did you see them did you hear about them i didnt know where tostop so many questions. those young men didnt say a word. finally i stopped asking questions and they look at me very sad and they said livia im sorry your brothers wont come home. what i couldnt believe it. what do you mean and know after  years i still think how could i be so dumb for so being so surprised. and while i was inauschwitz   months i saw daily people being women being killed for no reason at all. our houses were destroyed because after we were deported the gentiles started to search for gold. they razed the houses anddug pits to look for it. i met one man who idknown before the war and he asked me why didthe germans leave you alive why didnt they turn you into soap after hearing that i understood that there was no longer a place for me here. we were hated becausewe returned from the dead. they thought of us as dead and buried. they were quite satisfiedthere were no more jews and no more jewish problem. our return was a painful surprise to them. they looked upon us as ghosts. no one loves ghosts. the czechs looked at you how dare you come back. in poland the antisemitism was worse. there they killed you for coming back. in a village near vilna five of the few jews whohave survived the war are found murdered. their bodies are broughtto vilna for burial. stuffed into some of their pockets is a message written in polish this will be the fate ofall the surviving jews. by the end of the summer millions of refugees find their way back to their homes and loved ones. only the jews have nowhere to return. all those days wehad struggled to survive hour after hour day after day. there had been no time to graspthe enormity of our tragedy. now everything became clear. no longer were ourfamilies waiting for us. no homes to go back to. for us the victory had cometoo late much too late. homeless and unwanted jewish survivors begin to converge on america zone of germany and austria. over  assembly centersare hastily set up in former slave laborcamps stables fields wherever the allies can find space. the smallest centershold  to  refugees the larger more than . the dps were assigned to camps according to their country of origin. jews are mixed in withthe general population of displaced personslithuanians latvians ukrainians croatians estonians many who had voluntarily entered germany during the war years to aid the nazis. the man in the next bed could well be a nazi sympathizer orcollaborator or even murderer. american general george s. patton jr. insists that every camp besurrounded by barbed wire and manned by armed guardsto watch over the detainees. when i look out mywindow i see the barbed wire. my heart grows cold. and when i go with mypop to go get my meals i feel as though im stillin concentration camp. everywhere dps lack basic supplies and amenities. food is meager and clothing is scarce. the occupying troopsare unprepared to deal with the hundreds of thousands of refugees who speak a babble of languages and have suffered unimaginableanguish and degradation. untrained to handle the dps the soldiers fall back on what they know bestmilitary discipline. i saw that my family was dead and the germans were still alive. and i asked if there was agod how could this happen so many people needed a helping hand and no one cared. people committed suicide. there was no one to help us adjust. why am i alive i dont know. maybe this is a punishment. at this moment i amalone and i have nobody and i am living. we were weak we were starving. we were in a state of apathy. we simply sat and stared into space. it is better tobe a conquered german than a liberated jew. i am angry at the world. the world stood stillwhen we were burning. so much pain so much pain. how to get rid of it  when i arrived in dachau i had no assignment of any kind. no one told me what to do. and i watched the doctors and nurses as they went about their rounds. and i felt completely lost in the sense that here werepeople working endlessly trying to save whatever souls they could. and i was unable to be part of that team. i began to walk up anddown the row of barracks wondering what was i going to do and finally i forcedmyself into a barrack. i opened the door and icame into this dark room where the people were still intheir concentration uniforms and were still living on shelves. a voice came from one of the shelves. and it was a very thinweeping voice and it said i had a brother we lived together. and he told me the communityin which they lived. and then he left us andwent to the united states and he became a rabbi. and the voice asked doyou know my brother no name was given except as the voice came towards me i was attracted by thetimbre of the voice the weeping in the voice. and before the voice was through i said yes i know your brother. and then the voice said to me dont say things that arenot true just to console me. i said im not consoling you. im going to bring your brother to you. and i rushed out of the barracks because i couldnt copewith the situation. i was afraid of it. but when i got outside i was so sure that i hadput the two voices together that i was satisfiedthat i came to dachau. if nothing else what everhappened i had done something. in reuniting thesurvivor and his brother now an army chaplain rabbi klausner discovershow he can help the dps. what they want most is to reconnect to their families and their community. klausner establishes acommittee of survivors to compile lists of jewsstill alive in germany. the thousands of names are published under the title sharit haplatah the surviving remnant. the six volumes are sent tojews throughout the world europe america palestine. halt besides the chaplainsthe other representatives of the free jewishworld to reach the camps are soldiers from palestine. near the end of the war england reluctantly allows them to fight with the british army in europe under the banner of the jewish brigade. we saw a jeep outwhich jumped two soldiers in uniforms of the brigade with stars of david on their sleeves. the joy was great. the openness the connectionbetween us is something that happens only once in ones life. and perhaps only at a specific time perhaps only then. but like theallied liberators before them many of the brigade are appalled by the condition of the survivors. we found acommunity of living persons who had mental termswere not much different from the bodies we had found.  jews like thesecould turn eretz israel into a lunatic asylum. i did not believe that thesesouls would ever be healed. the first jewishfrom the concentration camps to reach palestine arechildren who the allies ordered to be removed from germany without delay.  a month after our liberation we were already on our waythrough germany and france to go to eretz israel. the british authorities tookus by train from the port to atlit a camp where wewere surrounded with fence and nobody could enter. but because we were legal all the papers printed our names. this was the headline of course. first survivors of holocaustcame to eretz israel all of them orphans. our names and the namesof cities we come from were printed in all theplaces in eretz israel. i will never forget the shouts the beggings of very manypeople surrounding our camp behind the fence crying out the names of their families and their cities. greenberg warsaw goldberg kruker and we were only and the first the source of information ifwe have met them in a ghetto in the death camp inthe concentration camp in one of the trains. but the worldhas other priorities. thebiggest political surprise of  years was the resultof the general election. very few indeed thoughtthat when the ballot boxes left for safekeepingat the police stations the count would revealthe most sensational landslide since . the british voters turn out winston churchillswartime conservative party and elect clement attlees labor party to direct the peacetime recovery. attlee appoints ernest bevin as foreign secretaryof the new government.  when i saw thing results this morning i uttered a feeling of thankfulness that the british electorate had put an end to the very conception of personal government in this country. jewish leaders have high hopes that the new governmentwill ease restrictions on jewish immigration to palestine. but the economic and socialconditions of postwar england force labour to reexamineits previous policies. having spent a quarterof her national wealth on the war effort britainis now virtually bankrupt. with shortages everywhere oil becomes a crucial commodity and oil is to be foundonly in the arab world. by the late summerreports of the conditions of the dp camps begin toreach government officials in london and washington.  a colonel walked in and he said chaplain i have something to tell you theres a very important person coming from the united states. hes being sent by the president. he told me that. and hes going to visit the sites and my responsibilitywas to draw up his agenda and i want to show it to you. and i looked at it andof course i realized that he was going tobe not shown the scene. he realized and irealized what was going on between the two of us. and he told me im sorry chaplain. i cant do otherwise interms of the military but you can and i tellyou what im going to do. im gonna bring him to dachau. youre going to be there. im going to introduce him to you and you take it from there. the man klausnertakes around the camps is earl g. harrison the dean of the universityof pennsylvania law school who has been appointed tofind out how the us army is treating the people ithas supposedly liberated. harrison is outraged bywhat he sees and hears. the campis filthy beyond words. sanitation is virtually unknown. with few exceptions thepeople of the camp themselves appear demoralized beyondthe hope of rehabilitation. we are livinglike a litter of puppies cuddled under the body of their mother. when i undress at night i cant help feelingeverybodys looking at me. sometimes mother holdsthe blanket in front of me but sometimes shes too tired. after visiting  camps harrison files an interim report highly critical of the us armystreatment of the survivors. as matters now stand we appear to be treating thejews as the nazis treated them except that we do not exterminate them. they are in concentrationcamps in large numbers under our military guardsinstead of ss troops. one is led to wonder whetherthe german people seeing this are not supposing that we are following or at least condoning nazi policy. harrison urgesthe army to recognize the jews unique experienceof oppression and persecution and to house them in separate camps. he also urges that their food and clothing be radically improved and that they not besubject to army discipline. in his final report to president truman harrison stresses the jews desire to leave germany and austria and suggests that the british admit  of them to palestine. truman responds to harrisons report by cabling prime minister attlee and requesting as a humanitarian gesture immediate admission of refugees to palestine. before the harrison reportis even made public attlee turns down trumans request. im very sorryi cant say anymore. five dayslater the cabinet approves foreign minister bevins recommendation that jewish immigrationto palestine remain at  persons a month. yom kippur  thefirst day of atonement celebrated in freedom by the survivors. at feldafing the firstalljewish dp camp  jews come together to pray. the intensity of the prayers during that yizkor service is something i shall never forget. wails and crying of young and old some mourning for a childthat would never grow old others for a parent that would no longer be there to guide them others a brother or sister. it was as if only mournersattended these congregations. after the service the congregants welcometwo surprise guests generals eisenhower and patton who have come personallyto inspect the camps. rabbi halberstam therabbi of klausenburg presents eisenhower with salt and bread the traditional welcomeextended to a king. on the inspection tour eisenhower is distressedby the squalor of the camp. he makes it clear to patton that he wants an immediatechange in conditions. although afterwards pattonremoves the army military guard from the dp camps he notes in his diary that it is a serious mistake. ifthe jews were not kept under guard they wouldnot stay in the camps. they would spread overthe country like locusts and would eventually have to be rounded up after quite a few of them had been shot quite a few germans murdered and pillaged. harrison and his ilk believethe dp is a human being which he is not. this applies particularly to the jews who are lower than animals. as the harrisonreport is released to the press eisenhower transfers patton signaling to all the military that anyone who does not follow his orders to treat the jews differentlywill be held accountable. in the united states the worlds indifference tothe survivors of the holocaust unites the jewish community. for the first time practically every majorjewish organization supports a demand for ahomeland in palestine. in palestine the british decision to maintain restricted immigration also unites the jewish community. now that the war is over three mutually hostileunderground groups ally to form the resistance movement. the militant irgun is led by polish immigrant menachem begin whose parents and family wereall murdered by the nazis. the irgun joins withthe smaller stern gang under the militaryleadership of yitzhak shamir and the larger haganah a defense force which had been organizedto protect settlers against arab terrorism. they begin guerrilla attacksagainst palestine railways and airfields and britishmilitary installations. jerusalem was the scene of more outrages. bombs placed in therailway station resulted in the loss of more british lives. shortly before the explosions a girl had driven up in a taxi and deposited severalsuitcases in the station. and although the britishsergeant removed one of them and the other two blew upwhen he was taking them out and killed him instantly. here are some of the men arrested for the alleged complicityin the murderous attack. theyre all reportedto be of polish origin. in europethe haganah also steps up its activities to help bringthe refugees to palestine.  i was down in a town in southern bavaria called bad tolz and the phone rang and a lady is on the phone. i was  years old notmarried no responsibilities and when the lady says wouldyou come and meet me in paris in room  of the royal monceau hotel i couldnt think of onegood reason to say no so i went. the minute that i saw the lady i realized that one of my motives was certainly not to be fulfilled. she kept me out in the hall and said will you work for us and i said whos us and she said haganah. now i knew what the word meant. i had no idea of whatthe implications would be of what she would request. sometimes youve got to sayyes or no according to the gut so i said yes. at that point i was invited in. she sat me down and gaveme my marching orders. i was shocked. she said okay heres what we want. were gonna be moving streams and streams of surviving jews andwere gonna be bringing them from far away in eastern europe. were gonna bring them to germany and youre gonna becomepart of that process. eastern europeanjews who had fled deep into russia to escape the nazis or who had fought with the partisans or hidden in the forestsnow turn westward. their route leads to the dp camps in the american zonesof germany and austria then to selected seaports and palestine. this migration of refugeesis called the brichah the hebrew word for flight and becomes the largestillegal mass movement in modern times.  many a night i would make the trip leaving at dusk from my housein a convoy of six trucks and a couple of jeeps foreand a couple of jeeps aft and up we would go. the loading a matter of  minutes. if the people were carrying little bags or little suitcases wedthrow everything away to make room for one more person one more person on the truck. the specific thing that i needed in order to keep that operationgoing was cigarettes. cigarettes was the currencyof the black market. a package of cigarettes was worth  a carton  packs worth . it cost me one carton per jew. thats  worth ofcigarettes every single night. you had to bribe the polish side you had to bribe therussians on the russian side and you had to dump the big bag full of  cartons of cigarettes on the ground and leave it there and they divided it up among themselves. the fuhrer musthave had full knowledge of what was happening with regard to concentration camps the treatment of the jews. i alreadymentioned it as my opinion that the fuhrer did not know about details in concentration camps. im not asking about details. im asking about the murder offour or five million people. are you suggesting that nobody... while the survivors struggle to build a future aninternational military tribunal tries to assess guilt and punishment for the crimes the nazis have committed. i am still of the opinion that the fuhrer did notknow about these figures. on christmas eve  the nazi defendants celebrate together in the secondfloor double cell which has been converted into a chapel the accused war criminals feel certain that this is their last christmas. goering tells the others. if ive got to die id rather die as amartyr than as a traitor. dont forget that thegreat conquerors of history are not seen as murderers genghis khan peter thegreat frederick the great. the time will come when the world will think differently about all this. nearly eight months after the miracle of liberation the liberated jewsstill wait for the world to welcome them back. but the allies have madeno significant strides toward emptying the dp centers. as the new year begins there are  alljewishcamps in the american zone and with the influx ofeastern european jews the population grows.  the spirit of the people was prompted by the negative condition that was imposed upon them. it was like a man in apit that wants to get out. now they knew they werentgoing to remain in germany. the question is wherewere they going to go and they knew also theylearned very quickly they had to be part of the battle. i wasnt that somebody wasgoing to do something for them. they had to battle their way out. my deep zionist commitment helped me to overcome thepsychological difficulties that many people sufferedfrom the holocaust. it want long after liberation that we began planning for the future. since the turn of the century the goal of the zionistshas been to create a selfreliant jewishcommunity in palestine. now zionist groups springup in a number of camps. the zionists even manageto establish a kibbutz a collective agricultural training farm for life in palestine. through our physicallabor in this kibbutz we mean to demonstrate thatwe are not yet destroyed but that we have the willto live and to build. the camps become centers of jewish cultural life as well. the dps establish schools that teach both zionism and judaism the two sustainingfaiths of the survivors. those of us who remain those of who are the lastremnant of our people must once more have hope for the revival of all those values which we hold so dear. we owe that to the memoryof our dearly beloved dead who had the same yearnings. we owe it to them tospend our remaining days in creating a worthy life once more. it was an accidentif you survived or not. the only thing you could contribute was not to be sorry foryourself not to give in not to let them hypnotize you into believing that youare something inferior. we were young together and we wanted to enjoy life. there were some people whocouldnt get rid of it. some people are weakerand some are stronger.  dont be sad now   little on little one   i command you  we had peoplefrom  to  countries people with different mentalities different languages different cultures but in some way we meltedtogether to make one family.  my husband was a polish survivor. he didnt have in the world anybody. everybody got killed brothers sisters nephewsnieces a wife and a baby. and when we met we likedeach other kind of so after four days heproposed and i accepted. there was at least one wedding every day at bergen belsen. people paired themselvesbecause you had nobody. out of loneliness we got together. i came into thedp camp like a stranger no family no one to talk to. i felt so alone. i felt like a rock in the water alone. i got married and pregnant but i wasnt ready to make commitment. it was only because i was so lonely. under normal circumstanceswe would never have married. most of the survivors choose another survivor for a mate.  i didnt even have a dress so i made myself a white skirt and somebody lend me a white blouse. i dont even know on my head what i had. i didnt have a beautifulveil or anything just maybe a scarf who knows and my husband i dontknow if he had a suit even. when there was wedding the whole camp came tothe wedding to celebrate like we were all related. every wedding was celebrationfor the whole camp.  and that was it. you know about four girlsshared the room in the camp so they did me a favor andthey went to somewhere else and we had our our youknowwhat. anyway so this was the wedding and we lived happy for years. in january the united states and england appoint a joint committeeto investigate the problems of the refugees in relation to palestine. the committee has six americansand six british members.  i joined the angloamerican committee of inquiry on palestineas a foreign correspondent for the new york post. we entered germany. then we talked to someof the people themselves and we began to learn notonly what they had suffered and what theyd gone throughbut how they felt now that they wanted to go to palestine that they had survivedso that they could go to this county they feltwas really their home. and a yearold boy was furious with us. he said why do youask me these questions why do i wanna go why dont you ask the world that everybody has a home. the british have a home. the french have a home. the americans have a home. only we dont have a home. ask the world why theydont let us go home. in a poll of over jewish dps in germany  declare that they wantto settle to eretz israel. when asked in a second pollto pick a second choice if palestine is unavailable hundreds write in crematorium. bartley crum one of theamerican representatives on the committee is deeply affected by the people he meets. i remember the clarity with which on witness put it. he explained that only the zionists goal could make the dps work. they had done such inhumanelyhard labor for the nazis that their attitude to workcould become positive again only when they wereinspired by a great ideal. i myself he saidwould never have wanted to work a days work again in my life if i were not imbued withthe ideal of palestine. the committeemoves on to the mideast to interview both jews and arabs. dr. chaim weizmann president of the worldzionist organization is the first witness. despite all promises by british and americanstatesmen and leaders jews are able to enter palestineonly as illegal immigrants. european jewry cannotbe expected to resettle on soil drenched with jewish blood. their only hope for survivallies in the creation of a jewish state in palestine. for the refugees the clandestine route to palestine leads over a hazardous footalpine pass to italy. all night long westruggled through the snow. sometimes we were led on a path of sorts but often there would bedrifts across the path through which adults waded waisthigh carrying the children. it was tough. winter we had to trudgefor hours through the snow hungry and frozen. we were exhausted very exhausted. this is a new type of person tempered by incredible suffering. no matter how closelythe borders are watched these people will movefrom country to country toward the mediterranean seaports. they are resolved thatnothing will stop them. beyond themountains remains the sea. under cover of night the refugees board leaky cargo ships secretly bound for palestine. the boats are often purchased in the us and manned by american crews.  there i was in the ivorytower of the harvard law school and i became aware for the first time what had transpired in europe and i didnt see how i as a jewish boy could stay there whilehistory was being made. harvard law school would always be there. this was a moment in history. this was when the jewswere changing the world. they were leaving the ghettos of europe and they were going to go to palestine. they were going to form their own state and i had to be a part of that. they were pulled into our ship from shore in rubber rafts all in complete silence as if it were a movie filmwith the sound track cut off. old people young people kids they had to climb the ladders to come aboard the ship. and most of them were individuals who had no survivingmembers of their family. they each carried a water bottle and a small pack on their backs which were the sole possessionsthey had in the world. i remember a bearded gentleman and i was urging himto get in and climb in and he stopped me and hesaid to me in yiddish he said and i will not say it in yiddish. what he said to me was wait a minute he said i wasonce master of my own house. and it really struck me that it was just by the sheerest blind fatethat i was not in his position that i was a wellfed americanwho had survived the war in comfort and was now directing him couldve been my father. with refugees crammed on board the passengers are onlyallowed on deck in shifts. for most of the voyage they remain cooped up in the holds to avoid detection by the british.  we saw a plane fly overus and it was a bomber and it crisscrossedover us several passes. we knew wed been discoveredby a british search plane. then the people werepermitted to come out on deck. haganah had made the decision that if we were interceptedwe were to resist and of course we all agreed with that. first we didnt intend to submit to this wrongful act onthe part of the british and to accept what they were doing like sheep going to the slaughter or going meekly into the crematoria. we were going to fight them. secondly resistance was important to demonstrate to the worldthat we were not going to be be impeded in our insistence upon going to our own country to our own land. it was our right to go. the british marines jumped aboard. they had shields. they had helmets. they had long clubs with leadon the end and they had guns. and there was a fight. they succeeded in taking the wheelhouse and had the fighters segregated in groups with guns pointed at them. as we were towed into haifa harbor three of us dropped into the water. i was caught by a patrol boat after id been in thewater about  minutes. beginning in   ships carrying nearly refugees tried to cross the mediterraneanto the promised land. only six managed to evadethe british gunboats and reach the shores ofpalestine undetected. the british take theseverely wounded and injured to hospitals and transfer allthe rest to detention camps. in may  the angloamerican committee submits a unanimous report recommending the immediate admission of  jewish immigrants to palestine. although president trumanpromptly endorses the report the british just as quickly dismiss it. attlee tells the house of commons that before any immigrationinto palestine can take place the haganah and otherillegal jewish armies must disarm and disband completely. in june at a labour partyconference bevin adds. regarding the agitation in the united states andparticularly in new york for  to be put in palestine i hope it will not bemisunderstood in america if i say with the purest of motives that that was because they do not want too many of them in new york. in the united states even though immigration isalready severely restricted many see the arrival of any foreigners as a threat to the american way of life. patriotic groups like theveterans of foreign wars want to ban all immigration for aperiod of five to  years. letters to the whitehouse and congress run seven to one againstallowing dps into the us. the word refugee is synonymous with jew and the latter is synonymous with red states one writer. a year after the defeat of germany the communists replace thenazis as americas chief enemy and its major concern abroad. to win german support in thebattle against communism secretary of state jamesburns rides hitlers train through germany andsleeps in his compartment. in stuttgart he assuresa group of industrialists that if they stand withthe us in the cold war they will be able to keeptheir factories and industry.  the american people want to return the government of germanyto the people of germany. the american people wantto help the german people to win their way backto an honorable place among the free and peacelovingnations of the world. germans respond with relief to the secretary of states message. they realize that the americans will not punish german corporations for their complicity with hitler. german industrialists who had used concentration campinmates as slave laborers during the war are nowgiven a second chance. the americans are willing to overlook their crimes against the jews as long as they join in theeconomic war against communism. the western allies arealso willing to ignore the crimes of hitlersother collaborators. during the war the nazis plundered millions of dollars in gold from the countries they conquered and the jews that they murdered. after the war fearingthe spread of communism the us england and france award  million of the captured gold to hitlers formerallies austria and italy. although money is also setaside to run the dp camps the funding ends whengreat britain objects. newday of crisis in palestine as the british complete anintensive search for weapons at a jewish settlement at yagur. precipitating the recentwaves of violence in palestine was britains failure to carryout early recommendations to admit  homeless european jews. in palestine the  members of the hebrew resistance movement respond to attlees call to disarm by escalating the violenceagainst the british. convinced that only forcewill change british policies members of the underground blow up bridges and damage key industries in a declaration that they will no longer wait passively for the camps to be emptied. the british with  troops and  policemen in palestine retaliate with drastic reprisals. at dawn june   called black sabbath by the jews every available britishsoldier and policeman sweep down on the jewishagency headquarters and  settlements throughout the country. house by house they searched for membersof the jewish resistance. in all they arrest  jews and send them to internmentcamps without trial. but none of the haganahcommanders are captured. menachem begin leaderof the militant irgun decides that a counterattack is needed. palestine. at british army headquarters in the fashionable king david hotel the everpresent unrest suddenly exploded. one wing of the hotel demolishedby a time bomb planted by agents of underground extremists. andcasualties were very heavy. leaders of the jewishagency have expressed horror at the dastardly crime perpetrated by a gang of desperadoes. as these first films of the tragedy were issued the death tolls stood at . among the casualtieshighranking british officials prominent jews and arabs. the finaldeath toll reaches . and although the worldcondemns the terrorism the mounting cost in lives and money undermines british resolve tocontinue its colonial rule. in poland the jews who have remained also reconsider there future. on july   in kielce  of the towns  jews are murdered after a nineyear old boyclaims that he has seen jews kill christian childrenfor ritual purposes. the lynch mob is led bymembers of the clergy and the local militia. the kielce pogromthat was a bitter one. a ripple went through all of europe. general mcnarney head of the us forces in europe sends rabbis friedman and philip bernstein to warsaw to determine how the murders might affect the refugee problem. the rabbis visit four of the most powerful figures in poland. the first is the american ambassador.  you were either in favor of the state being established at some point under some set of conditions or you were not in favor of it and he was not in favor of it. and he said these damn jews they just they create problems all the time. second theyvisit the catholic cardinal.  he said i have nothing to tell you. these jews brought it on themselves. they are all communists. the third person they see is the polish prime minister.  and he said i can understand ifthese jews want to flee. i can understand if theywant to flee toward germany where the american flag isand that represents safety. i understand all of that but i cant do anythingabout it to help you. finally they speak to the head of the communist party who is a jew. and he said if there was a pogromthere was a pogrom. there have always beenpogroms in jewish history so whats the big deal theres nothing so terrible about it. im sorry for it but itsirrelevant in history. and we wrote the reportthat the military command in germany could expect overthe period of the next year to a year and a half approximately people to come flooding in from the east to the west. and if you want to close the borders and you want to try to preventthese jews from coming in then youre gonna haveto do it by armed force. general mcnarneysends rabbi bernstein to washington to present the problem to the commander in chief. president truman quicklymakes his decision keep the borders open. in the next three months people leave poland and enter the american zoneof germany and austria hoping to immigrate to palestine. parting was difficult. this was the place wherei was born and grew up. watching the countryside iloved from the train window i knew i would never come back. we have wandered enough. we have worked and struggled too long on the lands of other peoples. now we must build a land of our own. yet life in thedp camps is hardly more secure than the life the easterneuropean jews have left behind. the germans killed us says one refugee the british dont let us live. in the fall of  david bengurion comes to germany to inspect the situation for himself. rabbi friedman is asked totake him around the camps.  and i said to him what you have to do if i may be presumptuous what you have to do istry to lift the morale. and so he got up there. they were all standingwe didnt have seats. there were  peoplein the camp by now. he spoke to them inhebrew for a few minutes. this sentence i remember clearly. i come to you with empty pockets. and he took his pockets of his trouser and pulled them out you know insideout to show them that they wereempty he had nothing there. i have no certificates to give you. that meant i cannot take youto palestine in a legal way. therefore i have toask you for patience and i have to ask you to have hope because we want you we need you. and then he went on in a beautiful way to give them the feelingthat they were gonna be able to contribute to thebuilding of the future state. and our song is hopehatikvah is the song the hebrew word means hope. now lets all sing hatikvah. now he couldnt singhe couldnt. and i have a monotone asfar as singing is concerned. the two of us were upthere totally disarmed. i mean i said to myself oh if we only had somebodywho could start his song. but the song startedfrom among the people. and slowly but surelythe volume grew and grew and it came to a great crescendo. during the song he started to cry. he wasnt gonna say any more. he didnt say any more. but he was touched and every time i think of that i am also. we left the camp. we got in the car and wentto the city to the hotel. he said they will have patience. they will have weight and well build the country on them. despite the british gunships despite the hardships andperils of the journey the jews continued to make theirway illegally to palestine. in august of  thebritish begin deporting illegal immigrants who reach palestine to detention camps onthe island of cyprus.  you had to smell cyprus to believe it. to this day i can still smell cyprus. it was about  degrees i think but it felt like  degrees in the heat. and the people were living in tents and quonset huts squeezed together. there was no running water in cyprus. there was no privacy in cyprus. you smelled the garbage all the time. you smelled the sweat of the people as they leaned over the pots and pans where they were cookingtheir food outdoors cause there were no kitchens indoors. i felt that these peopleeither had complete despair or such hope and faith thatnothing could stop them. there was both strength in some of them and a sense of the worlddoesnt care about us. weve suffered and well go on suffering. they looked at you with a kind of apathy and at the same time thinking and you knew that they were thinking well somebody from earthhas come down into hell to see what this purgatory looks like. and yet despite that babies were born in one year.  many women stopped menstruating particularly in the camps. they were mortified thatperhaps they would never be able to have children. so they very eagerlywanted to have a child if only to prove to themselves that they are still viable human beings but more importantly recreating a family was an act of defiance against hitler. both in cyprus and in europe the dp camps have the highest birthrate of all the jewishcommunities in the world. by the end of  a thousand jewish babies areborn each month in the camps.  one day i didnt feel so good. i went to doctor andthey said im pregnant. i was so happy im pregnant. i ran to the office andi say to the other woman im pregnant im gong to have a baby and she says oh liviaim so sorry to tell you. what you mean why arent you happy for me she says exactly this morning i got a notice that you should come for the visa to go to america. i said so what i can go to america. no the baby has to be a half a year old before they can let me go. well it spoiled a little the happiness but i was never sorry that i was pregnant. every mother loves their children but to me they replacedmy parents my brothers my uncles and cousins and everybody. parents cant be replaced but at least i had something my own. so um we came to america in . most survivorsthat went to israel went because of their belief in zionism and wanting to build a jewish land. most survivors who cameto the united states came because they had relatives here and they believed that theycould recreate a family and a sense of family. so they came with that longing. even on the boatcrowded with jewish refugees we were already turned to the future. nobody told stories of the past but everyone had a story to tell. there was expectation ofnew things in the air. i felt completelyat home the first day. i had left nothing on the other side but misery and tragedy and horror. it was like emerging fromthe ashes like a phoenix with this exhilarating feeling of freedom. the tragedy was in meand would stay with me but for the time beingthis was my rebirth. i felt like a hunchback withthe hump somehow removed who can straighten outand walk like a man. even in americathough even among jews the survivors meet with a mixed reception. from the way peoplelooked at us as if to say how come my brother didntsurvive and you did i felt as if i had toapologize for surviving. so i put a bandage on my number so i wouldnt have to talk about it.  when i came here i want to tell why brother the whole story because he didnt know anything how our parents got killed and what i know butthey didnt wanna listen. he said forget it why should you they were sorry that i should be upset but to me it would havebeen good if i talk about it. but they didnt wanna listen forget it. we cant forget it. but dont talk about it and dont okay so i learned not to talk.  we really didnt understand what the survivors were telling us. the stories sounded too horrible. we simply did not believe them. they needed help and we had no idea what they were talking about. they would say you live in america now. the past is the past. let bygones be bygones. the reactions they receivedhere were sometimes so insensitive thatits shameful to repeat. like a survivor would tell about auschwitz and people would say wellwe had it hard here too. we had to stand in line for cigars. or did you really never get a dessert or without toilet paper how could you live without toilet paper or what did you do to survive there was an assumptionthat if you survived you must have committed immoral acts. so their reception was extremely different and not respectful. after a whilei didnt want to speak about the holocaust atall so i just decided to give up to forget everything and avoid anything that hadany connection to the past. for many of the survivors this retreat into silence lasts for years.  persons die and  others are injuredas extremists blow up the officers club at haifa in an unremitting campaign of violence. by early  the british have reached abreaking point in palestine. almost no night passeswithout a sabotage attack against their military installations. in january  the wives and childrenof british servicemen are evacuated to britain. harassed by unrest andrevolt in india egypt and other parts of the commonwealth the british begin thinking of cutting their losses in palestine. in january during one of theworst winters of the century rabbis friedman and bernsteinvisit ernest bevin in london.  hes sitting there behind his desk all wrapped up in a furcoat scarf around his neck a hat on his head and a little tiny electricheater by his feet. i mean this was the foreign minister of the empire of great britain. and he was in a lousy mood. now i cant really repeat the conversation because it was one of themost profane conversations. i mean it was just an incessant barrage. you jews are the cause ofall the trouble in the world. no wonder everybody hates you. you are never satisfied. you are always wheedling upand asking for something. and finally at the end hemade this terrible outburst and im gonna get rid of thewhole goddam fing problem because why the hell shouldengland have it on her back im gonna throw it to theblankblank united nations. let them struggle with it. a month later bevin announces in parliamentthat he is referring the palestine questionto the united nations. the jewish delegation meetsin the new york hotel suite of chaim weizmann to assess their chances.  surely the sovietunion would be against us and that meant five states. surely most of the latin american states would be against usbecause the vatican had this theological uh quarrelas it were with the jews. surely the social democratic countries who are a majority ineurope would be against us because they would goalong with mr. bevin who was flesh of their fleshand blood of their blood. and by the time wed finished listening to dr. weizmanns litany we went away in a rather chastened mood and thought it wasnt such a good idea from our point of view to have the united nations dealwith this question. on april th a special session of thegeneral assembly is convened at lake success long island to appoint yet another committee the th to explorethe palestine problem. few expect the session toyield any positive results.  but something very dramatic happened. up stands ambassador gromkyo and says first that the jewshave very strong roots in the history of theland called palestine. and second the western worldwas not able to save the jews from the horrors of theslaughter in europe. and third thereforethere should be examined the possibility of a jewish state. but of course whatcaptured the imagination was the words jewish state had emerged from soviet lips before theyd been heardin any definitive way even from the united statesor from anybody else. and at that point i began to believe that we really might makeit in the united nations. jerusalem bristling with british barbed wire isin a state of armed truce. in the ymca the united nations special committee on palestine under swedens dr.sandstrom opens hearings. in june thespecial committee on palestine unscop travels to palestineto begin its investigations. the committee includes representatives from  uninvolvedcountries which are assumed to be immune to the strategic interests of the major powers.  when i discuss our victoriesin the united nations i must give pride of placeto our arab adversaries because they made almost everymistake that could be made and they were the mistakes of arrogance. they seemed to have believed that they had the strategic superiority and when the unitednations made it possible for the jewish agency andfor the arab higher committee to appoint liaison officers on the arab side they turned it down. they werent even preparedto discuss the possibility of a jewish state even as a prospect. another eventalso critically affects the committees deliberations. in july the exodus set sailfrom france for palestine packed with  illegal immigrants more than any other previous ship. on july  six britishdestroyers intercept the boat off the coast of haifa. the british open fire. three people are killed and  wounded.  and then exodus came into the harbor. in front of it was acruiser called the ajax and destroyers were following it. and suddenly it dockedright where i was standing and there was a hole as big as the biggest open barn i had ever seen and the ship itself looked like a matchbox that had been splintered by a nutcracker. and now the britishhad them in the harbor and were forcing them off the ship. and they had refugee eyes the eyes of the peoplewho have been running and they have been running you know since hitler came to power some of them. and those who were badly wounded whose heads were already bandaged by the doctors among the refugees the british took off the bandages no matter how painful it was and if they really were badly hurt they were put on stretchers andtaken to hospitals in haifa. but if their wounds were not what the british considered serious they were forced onto thesesocalled hospital ships and everybody was toldtheyre going to cyprus. abba ebanpersuades emil sandstrom the swedish chairman ofthe unscop committee and the yugoslav delegateto see for themselves what is happening in haifa.  justice sandstrom said to me whatever happens thebritish mandate cant go on. if thats the only wayit can be fulfilled then it better not be fulfilled at all. despite whatthe solders have told the captured immigrants bevin orders the refugees returned to france instead of cyprus. but when the boats reach france the french refuse to accept any who will not disembarkof their own free will. no refugee leaves the ship.  the british announcedthat they would take three correspondents aboard the ships and they selected me torepresent the american press. they took me down into the hold and this socalled hospitalship was a prison cage. there were no beds. the people were lying halfnaked one head here feet heresqueezed against each other. each one of those prison ships had  people in that heat. they began to say to me take pictures take pictures of our children. and i was taking pictures and i didnt know what i wasshooting because i was blind. i was blind because the onlylight came from prison bars that were on one side of them. and and i was blind with their agony. and a woman lifted a baby up and said take a picture of my baby. and i took a picture. i said its a beautiful baby. and she said yes i knowbut and she shook her head. and i said how old are you and she said  she looked at least . and i said dontdont worry thisll end. youre going to get there. i said everything stupid in the presence of someoverwhelming tragedy. but she was much wiser than i and she said no my life is wrecked but im going to live. im going to live sothat my child will live. im going to live so that no jewish child will ever be burnedin a gas chamber again. im going to live and then i realizedthat this whole odyssey that this whole terrible journey had been made for the children. eventually thebritish send the refugees on to germany and intern the passengers in several of the formernazi concentration camps. while they languish behind barbed wire unscop issues its report. seven of the  membersof the committee recommend partition of palestineinto two separate states one arab and one jewish with the city of jerusalem to be under international trusteeship. but passage of the unscop recommendation is by no means certain. to win internationallegitimacy for statehood a  majority of the uns member countries is necessary. although president truman supports the creation of a jewish homeland many in his administrationdo not share his views.  i had a very close friendshipwith james forrestal who was secretary of defense. we were talking one time. he said why dont youfellows in the white house get hold of yourselves. he said there are  million arabs and about  jews and ultimately thearabs will push the jews into the mediterranean. doubts aboutthe united states position create uncertainty inlatin american countries which represent  of the un vote. nations like the philippines and liberia accustomed to following the american lead on international issuesalso remain uncommitted.  when we reached thefirst voting opportunity on the th of november wejust did not have the votes. therefore we had to gain time. one way of gaining time was to do what un members usuallydont object to doing which was to make very long speeches. and i remember going up to agentleman from a latin country and saying do you thinkthat your excellency could help us simply by making a filibuster for an hour and he said for me an hoursspeech is not a filibuster. its just simply a few remarks. as the speeches wear on the president adjournsthe general assembly for the thanksgiving holidaygiving the jews more time to try to win the decisive votes.  the memory of the martyrdom of the horrors of the holocaust although they hadnt really sunk in in any deep sense hovered in the minds and the recollections and the emotions of so many of the delegates there. and that even at that early stage before the holocausthad been fully explored in all its scope it did have the effect there was a stirring of conscience. and some people wonder what conscience has got to do with diplomacy but conscience did havesomething to do with diplomacy under the impact of these fearful events.  we will start it now.  afghanistan. no.  no. argentina. argentina abstention. australia. yes. france is a critical vote. the prospect of frenchabstention threatens to disrupt the entire west european front. france. yes. the outcomedepends on the votes of a handful of tiny nationswhose decision is in doubt until almost the last moment. in the end many are influencedby the actions of the us. united states. yes. yes.  the resolution of the adhoc committee of palestine was adopted by  votes against  abstentions. with only three votes to spare the united nationsauthorizes the establishment of independent arab and jewish states in a partitioned palestine.  the vote on the thof november was greeted in jerusalem by dancing in the streets a general air of jubilation. it justified feeling that wed made a stupendous breakthrough in the long saga of the jewish people acrossthe stage of history. we were happythat night and we danced and our hearts went out to every nation whose un representative had voted in favor of the resolution. we danced but we knew thatahead of us lay the battlefield. the arabsconsider the un decision unjust and inequitable. they argue that humanitarianrelief for the jews does not require dividing palestine into separate jewish and arab states. why should they alone have to pay the price for hitlers crimes they refuse to recognizea proposed partition plan and begin a campaign ofviolence against the jews. grim climax of tragedy in the holy land. two truckloads of explosives blown up in the heart of jerusalemsbusiness section killing almost  persons and wrecking some thousand buildings. the arab high command boasts of its responsibility forthis act of frightfulness. although the un plan calls for an independent arabas well as jewish state the arabs believe theirmilitary superiority can drive the jews out of palestine. their attacks mount against jewish settlements and civilians. the british governmentrefuses to intervene. in cyprus in germany in austria the survivors continue to wait for the gates of palestine to open. in the early months of the american government also turns against jewishinterest in palestine.  here was the position that the president of the united states was in. he believed in a certainpolicy regarding israel. his state department was opposed to him. his defense department was opposed to him. the rank and file of thosein our diplomatic corp were opposed to him. the british who had been the major power in that part of the worldwere opposed to him. he had everybody against him. that did not affect him. he believed that they wereentitled to a homeland and he was going to do all in his power to see what could happen. as the dayfor the final departure of the british nears thestate department sends the american ambassadorto bevin in a last attempt to persuade him toprolong britains tenure. but bevin has had enough of palestine. as the dawn breaks on may   the last day of the british mandate jewish arab and americanintentions are still uncertain. zionist leaders are not only divided about whether to proclaim their new state they havent agreed on a name for it. and if independence is proclaimed will anyone recognize or acknowledge it  hours before thestillunnamed nation is declared president truman meetswith secretary of state george marshall in the oval office. the president has asked clark clifford to make the case for recognition.  if i may say so i was really ready. i started at the beginning. and it was a very telling story. i gave a little historyof the jewish people what theyd been through. i had two or three excellentquotes from the old testament particularly from deuteronomy in which the lord said to moses this land shall belongto you and your people. i noticed marshalls face getting redder and redder and redder but i went right on as id planned. when i finished marshallcould hardly contain himself. he said mr. president hedidnt quite point his finger to him but he almost did. he leaned forward andhe said mr. president let me tell you something. if you were to select the policy that clifford has presented to you today i would be unable to vote for you in the election this coming november. total shock to everyone. on the afternoonof may th while the last british high commissionerdeparts from palestine the executive cabinet ofthe jewish agency meets to make their final decision. by a vote of six to four theydecide to declare statehood. by virtue ofthe natural and historic right of the the jewish peopleand of the resolution of the general assemblyof the united nations we hereby proclaim the establishment of the jewish state inpalestine to be called israel. when i heard thewonderful news announced on the radio i became fora short while speechless. then i burst into tears. mentally i was transportedto another location to the death camp auschwitz. in the severe frost a groupof young barefoot girls proudly walked their lastmile to the awaiting truck. as the truck startedtoward the gas chambers they broke into loudsinging of the hatikvah. at that time i said to myself that beyond any shadow of doubt this singing like a passionateprayer had reached heaven and that someday it would be answered. at  p.m. washington time the state of israel is announced. at  truman responds to their request and the united statesbecomes the first country to recognize the new state of israel. in the end having argued his position marshall agrees to acceptthe presidents decision rather than resign.  my own view is that israelwould not have survived without the support of the united states. the yearsof exile and wandering are finally over. at last the jews very a homeland where they can begin to build new lives. from  when the war ended until  when thestate was established i dont think theresanother period of three years which has ever been so determinative because we came out ofthe death into the life. the jewish people almost died i mean totally andfinally and irrevocably.  the period between theend of the war in  and the birth of israel in  for many of us who were active in it i think was the highlight of our lives.  my feeling about thisperiod and the work i did was that a tremendousopportunity had been given to me to prove myself as a human being.  we came out on the the ashesof holocaust to eretz israel now the state of israel to build in an old new homeland our lives. this is our continuity our eternity. the fact thatthe survivors chose again to live in this world that they were willingto give it a chance not only for themselves butto create a new generation to create a country for the jewish people a state i think thatsan absolute miracle. its a true testament for their humanity and i believe its a truetestament to the jewish people. as a private person i believe i can overcome the holocaust. a private person can learn to forget to put that pain and suffering behind him. but as a collective asmembers of the jewish people we can never forget. if we were notan eternal people before we are an eternal peopleafter the holocaust. we have not only survivedbut we have revived ourselves. in a very real way we have won but in a very real way we have lost. who knows what beauty and grandeur six million could havecontributed to the world we lost. the world lost. and yet we won. were going on. api.opensubtitles.org is deprecated pleaseimplement rest api from
